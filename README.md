A short description

# Documentation

- [The Github README, https://github.com/peterldowns/symcrypt](https://github.com/peterldowns/symcrypt)
- [The go.dev docs, pkg.go.dev/github.com/peterldowns/symcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/peterldowns/symcrypt)

The Github README is the primary source for documentation. The code itself is
supposed to be well-organized, and each function has a meaningful docstring, so
you should be able to explore it quite easily using an LSP plugin, reading the
code, or clicking through the go.dev docs.
